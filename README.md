Introduction
------------

There is a periodic need to work with exported LibGuide XML in Caltech Library.  This is a golang
package for working with the explorted data. Go provides a robust may of mapping simple data structures
to and from XML (or JSON). This makes working with XML very easy in a consistant fashion. It seem time to move beyond my usual Bash/sed/python scripts.

One program is currrently provided with springytools, __lgxml2sjon__ which converts a LibGuides
XML export file into JSON.


Installation
------------

This is a Golang package. It requires Go 1.16.x or better and can be installed by cloning the source repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/springytools). __jq__ is a JSON Query tool
written by Stephen Dolan and is available form https://stedolan.github.io/jq/ (it is used to view
and validate the JSON output before installing the tool lgxml2json)

1. clone the repository
2. change into the clone directory
3. test
4. build the command line tool __lgxml2json__
5. use __lgxml2json__ and test output with __jq__
  - Replace "LibGuides_export_XXXX.xml" with the file path to your exported LibGuides XML file
6. install __lgxml2json__

~~~
git clone git@github.com:caltechlibrary/springytools
cd springytools
go test
go build cmd/lgxml2json.go
./lgxml2sjon LibGuides_export_XXXX.xml export.json
jq . export.json
go install cmd/lgxml2json.go
~~~


Known issues and limitations
----------------------------

This library is currently written to perform the LibGuide link analysis.
It only provides the commands I needed to do the data anaysis. It will grow as needed.

The exported XML output from the LibGuides may not be valid UTF-8.  UTF-8 encoding
is required to successfully parse the export file. Looking at the raw XML markup in __vim__
I noticed a number of control code sequences. This corresponded to the errors on parsing
the unsanitized XML file. The problem characters appear as `^A, ^K, ^L, ^S, ^C, ^R`. These
maybe non-UTF-8 characters embedded as UTF-8 when the rich text documents were pasted in via
the LibGuides edit UI. My hunch is these were pasted in/imported from Word documents. Remove
the offending characters allowed the export to parse successfully. These edits are distructive
as some of the codes probably prepresent UTF-8 characters used in non-English European names or
termonology.
