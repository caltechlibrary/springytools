Introduction
------------

There is a periodic need to work with exported LibGuides XML in Caltech Library.  This is a Golang
package for working with the exported data. Go provides a robust may of mapping simple data structures
to and from XML (or JSON). This makes working with XML very easy in a consistent fashion. It seem time to move beyond my usual Bash/sed/python scripts.

One program is currently provided with springytools, __lgxml2sjon__ which converts a LibGuides
XML export file into JSON.


Installation
------------

This is a Golang package providing two commands for working with LibGuides' exported XML. To
compile you will need Go 1.16 or better, GNU Make and Stephen Dolan's [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for browser JSON output.

### Steps to compile from source

1. clone the [repository](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/springytools)
2. change into the clone directory
3. test
4. build the command line tool __lgxml2json__
5. use __lgxml2json__ and test output with __jq__
  - Replace "LibGuides_export_XXXXX.xml" with the file path to your exported LibGuides XML file
6. install __lgxml2json__

Example commands to execute in the shell (e.g. Terminal on macOS, xterm on Linux)

~~~
git clone git@github.com:caltechlibrary/springytools
cd springytools
make
make test
make install
~~~

By default installation is to your `$HOME/bin` directory. This directory should be in 
your shell's "PATH".

You can get a brief description of the commands using the `-h` option with the command.

~~~
lgxml2json -h
lglinkreport -h
~~~


Known issues and limitations
----------------------------

This library is currently written to perform the LibGuides link analysis.
It only provides the commands I needed to do the data analysis. It will grow as needed.

The exported XML output from the LibGuides may not be valid UTF-8.  UTF-8 encoding
is required to successfully parse the export file. Looking at the raw XML markup in __vim__
I noticed a number of control code sequences. This corresponded to the errors on parsing
the unsanitized XML file. The problem characters appear as `^A, ^K, ^L, ^S, ^C, ^R`. These
maybe non-UTF-8 characters embedded as UTF-8 when the rich text documents were pasted in via
the LibGuides edit UI. My hunch is these were pasted in/imported from Word documents. Remove
the offending characters allowed the export to parse successfully. These edits are destructive
as some of the codes probably represent UTF-8 characters used in non-English European names or
terminology.
